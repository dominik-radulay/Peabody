# Peabody
Source code for my android game created via Unity

This game is based on Professor Martyn Amos FBCS's original idea from the 1980s. 
In this game, the player is given a character named Peabody, who is moved across the screen by rotating rows of bricks in the game area. 
The game has various types of blocks, each of which has a particular reaction with the player; 
some will crack when Peabody landed on them, moving the player one row lower, while others can kill the character, forcing the level to be restarted.
